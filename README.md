# jsonforms-primevue

This repository implements a [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) (version ^4.3) renderer set for [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io/) (version ^3.6).

__This is work in progress and not ready for production use!__

Most primitive controls have been implemented (ported from the Vanilla Vue renderer set). Layouts and more complex controls are still missing, as well as advanced configuration options.

At the moment, jsonforms-primevue renderers and the example app are in one and the same package. This will need to be split up in the future (help wanted!), before the renderer set can be published to npm. For now, you can install the renderer set directly from GitHub using a release tag and import it in your app as shown below.

## Install from GitHub tags

1) Add the dependency using a tag (recommended)

```bash
yarn add jsonforms-primevue@github:kobbejager/jsonforms-primevue#v0.2.0
# or with semver selector to auto-allow compatible updates
yarn add jsonforms-primevue@github:kobbejager/jsonforms-primevue#semver:^0.2.0
```

2) Ensure peer dependencies are installed in your app

```bash
yarn add vue@^3.5 primevue@^4.3 primeicons@^7 @jsonforms/core@^3.6 @jsonforms/vue@^3.6
```

3) Install and import a PrimeVue theme (CSS) in your app entry

```bash
yarn add @primeuix/themes
```

```ts
import '@primeuix/themes/aura/theme.css'
import 'primeicons/primeicons.css'
```

4) Use the renderers

```ts
import { primeVueRenderers } from 'jsonforms-primevue'
```

### Updating to a newer tag

- If you used a fixed tag: update `package.json` from `#v0.1.0` to the new tag (e.g. `#v0.1.1`) and run `yarn install`.
- If you used the semver selector (`#semver:^0.1.0`): run `yarn up jsonforms-primevue` to pull the latest compatible tag.

Note: release tags must include the built `dist/` artifacts. If you build locally from Git, ensure your environment can run the packageâ€™s build step.

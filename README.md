# jsonforms-primevue

This repository implements a [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) (version ^4.4) renderer set for [JSON Forms](https://jsonforms.io/) (version ^3.6).

__This is work in progress and not ready for production use!__

__Current Status__
All core renderers have been migrated to PrimeVue, and many configuration options are already available. However, the simple controls don’t yet fully conform to strict JSON Schema behavior. Additional variants for several renderers are planned for the near future.

__Package Structure__
Right now, the jsonforms‑primevue renderers and the demo application live in the same package. To prepare for an independent npm release, we’ll need to separate them (help wanted!).

__Installation (Temporary)__
Until the split is complete, you can pull the renderer set directly from GitHub using a release tag. Import it into your project as illustrated below.

## Install from GitHub tags

1) Add the dependency using a tag (recommended)

```bash
yarn add jsonforms-primevue@github:kobbejager/jsonforms-primevue#v0.3.0
# or with semver selector to auto-allow compatible updates
yarn add jsonforms-primevue@github:kobbejager/jsonforms-primevue#semver:^0.3.0
```

2) Ensure peer dependencies are installed in your app

```bash
yarn add vue@^3.5 primevue@^4.4 primeicons@^7 @jsonforms/core@^3.6 @jsonforms/vue@^3.6
```

3) Install and import a PrimeVue theme (CSS) in your app entry

```bash
yarn add @primeuix/themes
```

```ts
import '@primeuix/themes/aura/theme.css'
import 'primeicons/primeicons.css'
```

4) Use the renderers

```ts
import { primeVueRenderers } from 'jsonforms-primevue'
```

### Updating to a newer tag

- If you used a fixed tag: update `package.json` from `#v0.1.0` to the new tag (e.g. `#v0.1.1`) and run `yarn install`.
- If you used the semver selector (`#semver:^0.1.0`): run `yarn up jsonforms-primevue` to pull the latest compatible tag.

Note: release tags must include the built `dist/` artifacts. If you build locally from Git, ensure your environment can run the package’s build step.
